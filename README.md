### Hi there 👋 My name is Joy and I am a noob-ish technologist. 

🌱 Work is primarily done in R, Python and Javascript
✨ When programming, I strive for continuous improvement and not perfection
✍🏻 I also read and write a lot. I love to contemplate things because it allows me to make better decisions.
